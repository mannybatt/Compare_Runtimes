# Compare_Runtimes
A program that compares single-threaded performance against multi-threaded performance.

Currently this program uses an array of 200,000,000 Digits between 1 and 10 to determine
the performance that a single threaded load has against multi-threaded load. The results
are displayed in nanoseconds in the console is designed to take advantage of two threads.
